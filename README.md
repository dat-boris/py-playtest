# PyPlayetest

A library for implementing framework to do virtual playtesting for
boardgames.

- Provide basic components to make it easy to create new prototypes

- Wraps an API around the game you created to integrate with [OpenAI gym](https://gym.openai.com/)
  or a default integration harness.

# A Quick Demo

To see a demo of this game, clone this repo and run:

```
pipenv install
PYTHONPATH=. pipenv shell example/play.py
```

And you will be able to use our interactive harness to play the game.

```
📢: Resetting game.

📢: Start of next round!

📢: Player 0 - it is your turn!

📢: Let's see your two card.

🤔: How much you want to bet?

Player 0 taking action...
{'discarded': [],
 'others': [{'bank': 10, 'bet': 0}],
 'self': {'bank': 10, 'bet': 0, 'hand': ['7h', '7s']}}
👀 Please enter action ([bet(0->10)]):
```

And you can continue playing the prototype.

You can observe the code that generates the game (in a few lines of python!)
in [pt-blackjack/game.py](pt-blackjack/game.py).

# Getting started

To get started, read the docs at [here](#todo).

```
pip install playtest
```

Then can just `import playtest` and get started in creating your prototype.
