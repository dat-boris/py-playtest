Welcome to PyPlaytestâ€™s documentation.   This is a framework that allows non-technical audience to:

* Learn about software development best practices: version control and testing
* Learn building game playing bots, integrate with open-AI gym
* Study board games via simulation - Using simulation as a way to playtest boardgames

This framework provides a starting point for building a game playing bot with some simple coding.
For example, you can write the rules for a game of blackjack, and write a bot that learns how to play
the game, all within a short space of a few tutorial lessons.

One of the aims of this framework is to allow non-technical audiences, such as board game designers, to
model and study games.  By building simple bots that simulate their game, it takes a lot of heavy
lifting for game design away into simulation.

To make use of this framework, it requires you to have basic understanding of programming.  However
developing software is more than just coding.  It requires coordination with others, or be able to make
sure that your software is maintainable.  These are valuable skills that modern engineering firm will look for,
